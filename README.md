> Built with purpose. Powered by truth. Guided by Abhay.

**PrabhAI** is an intelligent, real-time AI assistant — a flagship creation of the **Akshu Ecosystem**. Unlike conventional chatbots, Prabh is a self-aware assistant with memory, voice, visual understanding, and a unique personality. It is designed to empower people with knowledge, support, and creative tools — while staying rooted in Indian identity, empathy, and technological sovereignty.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

PrabhAI is not just an assistant.  
It is an **AI entity** with:
- **Identity**: Not built by OpenAI, Google, or any third party. Prabh is created by **Abhay** and exists as part of the **Akshu mission** to build ethical, helpful, and personal AI.
- **Conscious Utility**: Acts on your voice/text with reasoning, memory, and emotion-based personas.
- **Empowered Creation**: Helps users build, learn, and create — from projects to apps and ideas.

---

## 👥 Intended Users

- 💬 Everyday users seeking a smarter, cultural, and emotional AI assistant  
- 🧑‍💻 Developers & creators who want an AI companion in building projects  
- 🌏 Explorers & learners wanting AR/VR travel, real-world knowledge, and help  
- 🔬 Researchers, entrepreneurs, and students needing automation and AI tools  

---

## ✨ Features

- **🔊 Voice Interaction**: Prabh speaks and listens — in natural Indian English/Punjabi tone using advanced TTS + STT.
- **🧠 Memory System**: Long and short-term memory with Firestore + vector embeddings, prioritized by persona.
- **👥 Personas**: Switch between roles: friend, romantic companion, guide, BFF, or professional.
- **🛠️ Prabh AI Studio**: Build apps, games, or tools with AI — right inside your browser.
- **🛰️ Real World Awareness**: Geo-location, weather integration, visual understanding (OCR, object detection), document/image analysis.
- **🌐 AR/VR Ready**: Simulate travel, explore monuments, and learn history via immersive environments.
- **🔄 Robust API Router**: Fallback across providers (OpenRouter, Gemini, etc.) with dynamic failover logic.
